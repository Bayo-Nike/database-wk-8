Database Design: E-commerce Store Management System

For this project, I'll design a simple E-commerce Store Management System. The system will track products, customers, orders, and order details. It will involve several relationships like one-to-many (e.g., one customer can place many orders), many-to-many (e.g., an order can contain many products, and a product can be part of many orders), and one-to-one relationships (e.g., a customer can have one shipping address).

Database Schema
1. Customers: Stores customer information.

Attributes: CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, Address

2. Products: Stores product details.

Attributes: ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price, StockQuantity

3. Orders: Stores information about each order.

Attributes: OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount

4. OrderDetails: Stores product details for each order (many-to-many relationship).

Attributes: OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, UnitPrice

5. ShippingAddress: Stores shipping addresses (one-to-one relationship with Customers).

Attributes: AddressID, CustomerID, AddressLine1, AddressLine2, City, State, PostalCode, Country

6. Categories: Stores product categories.

Attributes: CategoryID, CategoryName


Relational Constraints

PRIMARY KEY: Each table will have a primary key for uniquely identifying rows (e.g., CustomerID, OrderID).

FOREIGN KEY: To establish relationships between tables (e.g., CustomerID in Orders refers to CustomerID in Customers).

NOT NULL: Required fields like FirstName, Email, etc., will be defined as NOT NULL.

UNIQUE: Fields like Email in Customers will be marked as UNIQUE to ensure no duplicate emails.

Many-to-Many Relationship: Managed using the OrderDetails table, linking Orders and Products.
